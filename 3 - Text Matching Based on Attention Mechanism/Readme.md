# Text Matching Based on Attention Mechanism

Based on [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) and [TorchText](https://github.com/pytorch/text)
- [Dataset](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/) `SNLI` 
    - 570K条人工标注的英文句子对，label有三个：矛盾、中立和支持 
- [Word Emebedding](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)
